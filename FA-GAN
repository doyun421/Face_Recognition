FA-GAN :

Face Augmentation GAN for Deformation-Invariant Face Recognition

Face Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (FA-GAN)

Existing Methods are sensitive to
both the quality and quantity of the training data. Despite the
availability of large-scale datasets, the long tail data distribution
induces strong biases in model learning
when there are low level of quality data existed for training it can be results as biased result so it can conclude as error more than 10 %.
