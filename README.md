          using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition
          The model's accuracy 99.8% on Labeled Faces in the Wild 
LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) is a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching. (combining two similar things as one group)

- Face verification and other forms of face recognition are very different problems. For example, it is very difficult to extrapolate from performance on verification to performance on 1:N recongition. 

- Many groups are not well represented in LFW. For example, there are very few children, no babies, very few people over the age of 80, and a relatively small proportion of women. In addition, many ethnicities have very minor representation or none at all.
