# Face Recognition

## Face Recognition Use Cases
1) Health Care
  - Facial recognition can automatically scan the face of the patient and extract medical history and insurance information, reducing the workload for healthcare workers and reducing patient wait times. A recent study shows a 66% percent acceptance of facial recognition technology by patients to extract their information.
  - Facial recognition can also be used to diagnose medical disorders in patients with mild or difficult-to-detect symptoms.
