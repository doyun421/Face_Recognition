# Face Recognition

## Face Recognition Use Cases
1) Health Care
     
  - Facial recognition can also be used to diagnose medical disorders in patients with mild or difficult-to-detect symptoms. (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise by extract patients' expression, feeling of discomfort and lack of well-being, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell)
    e.g. fever: checking thermal infrared camera, cough: frown face, sore throat: holding patient's neck, etc.
    

2) Banking and Finance
- Customer identification and verification can be done through facial recognition.
- Similarly, facial recognition technology can make the customer onboarding process faster.(teaching new customers the value of product or service, keep in their mind their good memory on products by fastly passing onboarding process.)
  
- To reduce ATM robbies or banking fraud cases, facial recognition can be used to add another layer of security. after fingerprint recognition or bio recognition via vein recognition system.

3) Law enforcement and security services
   - Facial recognition has been widely used by law enforcement officers for a while now. It is mainly used to identify and record criminals or persons of interest.
   - Facial recognition is also deployed in various surveillance cameras throughout a city, such as at junctions,

## Face recognition Skills
1) PyPI -
          using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition
          The model has an accuracy of 99.8% on Labeled Faces in the Wild 
LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) is a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching. (combining two similar things as one group)

- Face verification and other forms of face recognition are very different problems. For example, it is very difficult to extrapolate from performance on verification to performance on 1:N recongition. 

- Many groups are not well represented in LFW. For example, there are very few children, no babies, very few people over the age of 80, and a relatively small proportion of women. In addition, many ethnicities have very minor representation or none at all.


step 1. Find all the faces that appear in a picture

### import face-recognition
python 3.3+

pip3 install face_recognition

installing on raspberry Pi 2/3 with 8GB memory card. 
Write it to a memory card using Etcher (burning the OS image onto removable external media) put the memory card in the RPI and boot it up

for run python3 and type import dlib.
1. Clone the code from github (dlib)
2. Build the main dlib library
3. Build and istal the Python extensions
